# Machine Learning Models

This repository is dedicated to showcasing various machine learning models. Each model will be uploaded separately, including detailed explanations and code implementations to help others understand how they work and how they can be applied to various datasets.

## Repository Overview

This repository is structured to help users understand machine learning models step by step, providing clean and modular code for each model. The models will be accompanied by well-documented Jupyter notebooks and scripts to ensure clarity in implementation.

## What's Included?

- **Data Preprocessing Scripts:** Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, scaling, and normalization.
- **Feature Engineering Scripts:** Transformations, extractions, and the creation of new features to improve model performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Code for evaluating models using different performance metrics, ensuring that each model is rigorously tested.
- **Future Model Uploads:** More models will be uploaded progressively, covering a range of machine learning algorithms.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aishjahan/Machine-Learning-Models.git

2. Follow the instructions within each folder to run and understand the model implementations.

Stay tuned for future updates where models will be added regularly!
